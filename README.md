The contents of different folders included in the repository are as follows:

+ `syllabus` contains tentative course syllabus for the current academic year 2018/19;
+ `lectures` contains course lectures code, handouts and other materials for programming languages Python (i.e. basic data analyses) and Java (i.e. graphical interfaces and games):
	+ Python lectures are included in subfolders `Px`, where `x` is a roman numeral within `[i,vi]` and
	+ Java lectures are included in subfolders `Jx`, where `x` is a roman numeral within `[i,vi]`;

	+ Java labs are included in subfolders `jx`, where `x` is a latin numeral within `[1,6]`;
+ `challenges` contains instructions for course challenges in programming languages Python and Java (three for each programming language);
+ `misc` contains miscellaneous code and other materials (currently empty).

#### Languages and dependencies

Earlier Python code and materials require [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/), whereas later materials require [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) or later. All Java code and materials require [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) or later.

Python code and materials assume that the following modules are installed: [httplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html), [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org).

Java code and materials do not assume any additional libraries.

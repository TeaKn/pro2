# Course _Programiranje 2_

This repository contains lectures and labs materials for the programming course _Programiranje 2_ at a professional mathematics study _Praktiƒçna matematika_ at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. The official course Moodle web page is available at [eUcilnica](https://ucilnica.fmf.uni-lj.si/course/view.php?id=130).

#### Contents and materials

The contents of different folders included in the repository are as follows:

+ `syllabus` contains tentative course syllabus for the current academic year 2019/20;
+ `lectures` contains course lectures code, handouts and other materials for programming languages Python (i.e. basic data analyses) and Java (i.e. graphical interfaces and games):
	+ Python lectures are included in subfolders `Px`, where `x` is a roman numeral within `[i,vi]` and
	+ Java lectures are included in subfolders `Jx`, where `x` is a roman numeral within `[i,vi]`;
+ `labs` contains course labs instructions and needed materials for programming languages Python (i.e. basic data analyses) and Java (i.e. graphical interfaces and games):
	+ Python labs are included in subfolders `px`, where `x` is a latin numeral within `[1,6]` and
	+ Java labs are included in subfolders `jx`, where `x` is a latin numeral within `[1,6]`;
+ `challenges` contains instructions for course challenges in programming languages Python and Java (three for each programming language);
+ `misc` contains miscellaneous code and other materials (currently empty).

#### Languages and dependencies

Python code and materials require either [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) or later. Java code and materials require [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) or later.

Python code and materials assume that the following modules are installed: [http.client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html), [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [xlrd](https://pypi.org/project/xlrd) and [mpl_toolkits.basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html).

Java code and materials assume that the following libraries are present: [VectorGraphics2D](http://trac.erichseifert.de/vectorgraphics2d/).
